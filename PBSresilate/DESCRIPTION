Description: Offers an interactive GUI to control solvers, calculate states, and
   display results in 2D or 3D plots for published 3-state models (specifically
   their derivative formulae). The current name reflects resilience theory and
   emphasizes a close association with other PBS packages, particularly
   `PBSmodelling'.
