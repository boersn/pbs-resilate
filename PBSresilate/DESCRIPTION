Description: This package uses an interactive GUI to control solvers, 
  calculate states, and display results in 2D or 3D plots for 
  published 3-state models (specifically their derivative formulae).
  The current name reflects resilience theory and emphasizes a close 
  association with other PBS packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
