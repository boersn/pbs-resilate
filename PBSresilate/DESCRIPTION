Description: Offers an interactive GUI to control solvers, calculate states,
   and display results in 2D or 3D plots for published 3-state models
   (specifically their derivative formulae). The current name reflects
   resilience theory and emphasizes a close association with other
   'PBS' packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
