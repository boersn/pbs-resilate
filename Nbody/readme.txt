A start  on the N-body problem.  Right now the code is very basic, and all data must be entered manually.  It doesn't yet check for correct data.
I've found that sometimes you need to set the value of G fairly high in order for the particles to behave in the expected way. Also, the program can sometimes run quite slowly.


TO DO:

Deal with r = 0
Figure out how to make the code more efficient?
