This branch of contains experimental code by Sanae Rosen to investigate particle movement under the influence of gravity. It may be become part of PBSresilate, because gravity seems to be a “lumping” influence on a complex system.

I think we may need an initial normalizing calculation (perhaps optional) to ensure that the system has initial net momentum zero. That would ensure initial values for which the centre of gravity does not change. Relative velocities among the masses would be preserved, but the system momentum as a whole would not move.

Similarly, we could require that the centre of gravity lies at (x,y)=(0,0). This calculation would preserve relative positions, but shift the overall location so that the physical centre lies at the origin.

The GUI related to PBSoptions could prove especially useful in Linux installations.
