This R package uses visual tools to investigate properties of complex models. In particular, it deals with resilience theory developed by C.S. (Buzz) Holling and his colleagues. Where possible, we employ graphical methods in R designed for three or more dimensions, such as **rgl** and **rggobi**. We also take advantage of differential equation solvers available in other R packages. 

**PBSresilate** belongs to a suite of R packages described at [http://github.com/pbs-software/](http://github.com/pbs-software/). It depends particularly on **PBSmodelling** ([http://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-modelling/](http://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-modelling/)).
